        <!-- Kevin's TIPS:-->
        <!-- When linking to other pages on the web, make sure it's the full URL. -->
        <!-- absolute links are made of "protocol://domain/path"-->
        <!-- https:// is protocol-->
        <!-- www.theodinproject.com is domain -->
        <!-- about is path-->
        <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/about">click me</a>

        <!-- When linking to our own page on the same website, use the HTML doc as the reference-->
        <!-- "About" is the word that will be hyperlinked -->
        <!-- relative links don't include domain name, only file path to the other page-->
        <!-- If you run into any issues, make it: ./pages/about.html -->
        <a href="pages/about.html">About</a>
